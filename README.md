Wow, just walked out, and my brain feels like it's been through a circus blender. The Amateur was… something else man. Can't shake off the smell of buttery popcorn dusting my jacket. Crazy how my back’s still stiff from those seats, but let's blame the  , not me turning into an old man. Ugh, what was that scene? The one with the typewriter—felt like it was writing the plot as it went, clunking away all awkward. Gah, there are still crumbs in my shirt.

Was it raining outside? Or did all the tears from the screen spill out here? The amateur guy—what was his name again? Felt like he was talking directly to me in some scenes. Like when you’re convinced the performer’s looking right at you in a crowded theater. That part where he ran into the girl with the orange scarf, remember?! The colors screamed like ice cream melting on hot asphalt, sticky and overwhelming.

> Wait, did Jace mention 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  ? Or maybe it was Nick. Told 'em to catch it because the quiet chaos might just be their vibe. But anyway—what I mean is the bit with the train station, kinda felt like life speed dating, right? Everything whizzing by too fast to grasp, but also too slow too. Funny how timelines get twisty like soft-serve ice cream during those long monologues. Pardon my scatterbrain, feels like my thoughts have taken the scenic route—thanks to whatever that was on the big screen.

The soundtrack sorta hummed under everything, like when you walk into a room and instantly forget what you were there for, music just floating around, invisible but felt. Voices sounded as if they weren’t in the same room, more like distant echoes in a cave—or maybe a bathroom. Yeah, that serene acoustic reverb where you can't decide if it’s comforting or just damp.

Might 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to get a hold of those puzzle pieces that keep sliding off the table. Some scenes had these loose strings, like, why did the cat keep showing up? Might've symbolized lost chances or was it just lost? Oh well, what a brain-bending ride.

Okay, wrapping up this tangled review. Oh, should probs click through the listings to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later. Hold up, my battery’s dying, real-life calling, literally.

```c
int MovieScenes() {
    int popcorn = 0;
    while(popcorn < 1024) {
        popcorn++;
        printf(Scene %d, , popcorn);
    }
    return popcorn;
}
